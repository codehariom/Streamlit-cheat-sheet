Here's what each section does:

    col1, col2 = st.columns(2)
    
This line creates two columns within the Streamlit app, dividing the available horizontal space equally between them. It assigns the first column to the variable `col1` and the second column to the variable `col2`.

    col1.write('Column 1')` and `col2.write('Column 2')
    
 These lines write text within their respective columns, allowing you to display content specifically within each column.

    col1, col2, col3 = st.columns([3,1,1])
This line creates three columns within the Streamlit app, with the first column being three times wider than the other two. It assigns the first column to `col1`, the second to `col2`, and the third to `col3`.

    with col1:` and `st.write('This is column 1')
    
This syntax uses a 'with' statement to specify that the following code block should be executed within `col1`. In this case, it writes 'This is column 1' within `col1`.



**Tabs Details**

    tab1, tab2 = st.tabs(["Tab 1", "Tab2"])
    
This line creates two tabs labeled "Tab 1" and "Tab 2" within the Streamlit app. It assigns the first tab to the variable `tab1` and the second tab to the variable `tab2`.

    tab1.write("this is tab 1")` and `tab2.write("this is tab 2")
    
 These lines write text within their respective tabs, allowing you to display content specifically within each tab.

    `with tab1:` and `st.radio('Select one:', [1, 2])

This syntax uses a 'with' statement to specify that the following code block should be executed within `tab1`. In this case, it displays a radio button widget labeled "Select one:" with options 1 and 2 within `tab1`.
