Here's what each section does:

    col1, col2 = st.columns(2)
    
This line creates two columns within the Streamlit app, dividing the available horizontal space equally between them. It assigns the first column to the variable `col1` and the second column to the variable `col2`.

    col1.write('Column 1')` and `col2.write('Column 2')
    
 These lines write text within their respective columns, allowing you to display content specifically within each column.

    col1, col2, col3 = st.columns([3,1,1])
This line creates three columns within the Streamlit app, with the first column being three times wider than the other two. It assigns the first column to `col1`, the second to `col2`, and the third to `col3`.

    with col1:` and `st.write('This is column 1')
    
This syntax uses a 'with' statement to specify that the following code block should be executed within `col1`. In this case, it writes 'This is column 1' within `col1`.
